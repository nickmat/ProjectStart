# ProjectStart - ![ProjectStart logo](./images/launch32x32.png) Launching Your Projects

### Version 0.0.1 - Initial Release

This Windows program is designed to open programs and documents
associated with your projects.
It can be pinned to the taskbar and used when starting work on your project.
It can replace Windows 10 taskbar toolbars.

To setup the program, create a directory somewhere convenient.
In that directory, create further directories for each of your major projects.
Between 3 and 8 is expected.
These directories will then appear listed in the opening frame of the program.

These directories act as toolbars do when added to the Windows 10 taskbar.
Clicking on them brings up a menu of the contents.
Selecting the menu item is the equivalent of double clicking the file
in file explorer.

### Initial Set Up

Set up an environment value:-

PROGRAMSTART=\<initial-directory>

(Settings - System - About - "Advanced system settings" (on right hand side))

Open the ProgramStart application and pin it to the taskbar.
